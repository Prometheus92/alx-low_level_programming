# C- Recursion

**Recursion** is the process of repeting items in a self-similar way. Hence if a program allows a fuction call inside a same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.

*_Recursive funciton_* is a fuction that calls it's self.

Recursion is a method that is used where the solution to a problem depends on the solution of a smaller instance of the same problem.
