# C - Singly linked lists
## Data Structures
Data structure implies the way of organizing or structuring data in order to efficiently store, find and use data.
There are different types of data structures like:
- Array
- singly linked list
- circulat linked list
- stack 
- queue ...
therefor the developer must choose the appropriate data structure for better performance.

## Linked List
Linkde list is a data structure that links each node to the next node.
**Advantages**
- constant time for insertion and deletion
- dynamic size
- Insertion and deletion of element in any position
**Disadvantage**
- Random access of elements is forbidn
- larger memory size(for data + pointer)

### Operations in Linked list
- Traversal(search)
- Deletion
    - Deletion at the front
    - Deletion in the middel
    - Deletion at the end
- Insertion
    - Insertion at the front
    - Insertion at the middle
    - Insertion at the end
